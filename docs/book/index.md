# oneplace-skeleton-skeleton

Building a module in onePlace can be really simple, once you learn a couple of quirks. 
The goal of this post is to create a skeleton plugin and introduce you to the basics.

The skeleton module gives you a starting point for creating any Webbased, data driven
App you can imagine. Want to manage your Contacts, Articles, Books, Albums, Worktimes,
Members, whatever you can imagine. 

onePlace gives you the tools to just develop a webapp on the fly based on a database model.
onePlace will create all the views / Html for you.


## How to add new fields

All you have to do is to run the install sql snippet from your 
[dynamic fields docs](https://docs.1plc.ch/oneplace-skeleton/dynamic-fields/) to add your extra field to your skeleton
module.
